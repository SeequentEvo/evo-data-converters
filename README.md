## Evo

Evo is a unified platform for geoscience teams. It enables access, connection, computation, and management of subsurface data. This empowers better decision-making, simplified collaboration, and accelerated innovation. Evo is built on open APIs, allowing developers to build custom integrations and applications. Our open schemas, code examples, and SDK are available for the community to use and extend. 

Evo is powered by Seequent, a Bentley organisation.

## Data converters

This repository provides the source code for Evo-specific data converters.

When running a converter, data is imported from a supported file format, converted into geoscience objects, and then published to the Seequent Evo API.

The existing data converters can be used as is, or you can use them as a template for your own integration.

## Repository structure

The top level sections for the repository are as follows.

- [Samples](samples/README.md) - Jupyter notebook examples for importing data with the existing data converters
- [Data Converters](src/evo/data_converters/README.md) - Source code for the data converters module (`evo.data_converters`)
- Scripts - helper scripts for working with different types of data files
- Tests - unit tests for the data converter module

### Evo authorisation and discovery

Whether using the converters or undertaking development work on the modules themselves, integration with Evo will require that you are granted access as an Evo Partner or Customer, along with access to a specific Evo Workspace. Access is granted via a token. For more information on getting started, see the [Seequent Evo Developer Portal](https://developer.seequent.com/).

Refer to the [auth-and-evo-discovery](samples/auth-and-evo-discovery/python/README.md) documentation to learn how to create an Evo access token and how to perform an Evo Discovery request.

## Setting up your environment

Whether using the converters or working on development of the converters the following initial setup instructions apply.

### Requirements

- Python >= 3.10, <= 3.12

### Using uv

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage all the python
versions, packages etc.

Run `uv sync --all-extras` to install everything you need.

Then use `uv run <command>` to run commands.

```shell
uv sync --all-extras
uv run pytest tests
```

## Using the data converters
See the documentation for each converter for information on how to use the data converters to upload or download geoscience objects from Seequent Evo.

Currently supported converters are:
 * [OMF](/src/evo/data_converters/omf/README.md)
 * [RESQML](/src/evo/data_converters/resqml/README.md)
 * [VTK](/src/evo/data_converters/vtk/README.md)

## Developing converters

See [Data converters](/src/evo/data_converters/README.md) for information on how to work on the Evo Data Converters.
This includes both importers and exporters.

We encourage both extending the functionality of the existing converters, or adding new ones for the object formats you would like to see.
