## Evo

Evo is a unified platform for geoscience teams. It enables access, connection, computation, and management of subsurface data. This empowers better decision-making, simplified collaboration, and accelerated innovation. Evo is built on open APIs, allowing developers to build custom integrations and applications. Our open schemas, code examples, and SDK are available for the community to use and extend. 

Evo is powered by Seequent, a Bentley organisation.

## Pre-requisites

* Python virtual environment with Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12
* Git
* Deswik Suite

## Installation

To do.

## DUF

Deswik Unified File (OMF) is a proprietary file format from Deswik Mining Consultants Pty Ltd.

### Publish geoscience objects from a DUF file
[The `evo-sdk-common` Python library](https://pypi.org/project/evo-sdk-common/) can be used to sign in. After successfully signing in, the user can select an organisation, an Evo hub, and a workspace. Use [`evo-objects`](https://pypi.org/project/evo-objects/) to get an `ObjectAPIClient`, and [`evo-data-converters-common`](https://pypi.org/project/evo-data-converters-common/) to convert your file.

Choose the DUF file you want to publish and set its path in the `duf_file` variable.
Choose an EPSG code to use for the Coordinate Reference System.

You can also specify tags to add to the created geoscience objects.

The flag `combine_objects_in_layers` can be specified `True` to cause the convert to attempt to combine objects of the
same type found in the same layer. For example, where a layer in the file contains only `Polyface` objects, these can
all be published as parts on a single Evo triangle-mesh object. Where a layer contains a mix of object types, or a 
single type, but the Evo type the objects map to does not support multiple parts, the objects will be published as
separate Evo objects.

Then call `convert_duf`, passing it the OMF file path, EPSG code, the `ObjectAPIClient` from above, optionally the flag 
`combine_objects_in_layers`, and finally a path you want the published objects to appear under in your workspace.

**Note:** Some geometry types are not yet supported. A warning will be shown for each element that could not be converted.

### Export objects to DUF

To do.
